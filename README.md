## 📌 Project Description

This project involves building a text classification model to categorize textual data into multiple classes. It includes preprocessing steps like lowercasing, stopword and punctuation removal, followed by feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**. The final classification is performed using **Logistic Regression**, with accuracy and classification reports used to evaluate model performance.
